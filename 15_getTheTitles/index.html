    FIND THE TITLES # Exercise 15 - Get the Titles! You are given an array of objects that represent books with an author and a title that looks like this: ```javascript const books = [ { title:
    'Book', author: 'Name' }, { title: 'Book2', author: 'Name2' } ] ``` Your job is to write a function that takes the array and returns an array of titles: ```javascript getTheTitles(books) //
    ['Book','Book2'] ``` ## Hints - You should use a built-in javascript method to do most of the work for you!
